# great-info

Some info that we can all share with some great links illustrating how to do....things.

I was thinking that perhaps we could have links to books and also websites that illustrate how to do specific things.
So we would have -

### Books
* JavaScript
	- Book 1 (title and link)
	- Book 2
* PHP
* HTML5
* CSS
* General Programming (Books that cover more than one topic/language)

### Sites
* JavaScript
	- Link 1
	- Link 2
* PHP
* HTML5
* CSS
* General Programming (some sites just have a wide array of posts and topics, these sire go here)
* Tools (Find any great web tools? well put these here)
